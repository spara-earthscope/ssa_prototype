    "# Matched Filtering Cross Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Matched filtering detects events missed by traditional phase picking methods. A template from an event is slid across continuous waveform data to find similar events by calculating a correlation coefficient at an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example of matched filtering cross correlation uses the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find known events for the area of interest within a range of dates and store them in a catalog.\n",
    "2. The type of events can be mixed, adding a known volcanic event will improve the probablity of finding volcanic tectonic events.\n",
    "3. Create an inventory of stations around the area of interest. Select stations with high frequency vertical channels that capture near source ground motion.\n",
    "4. For each station, create picks based on the catalog of events.\n",
    "5. Create 10 second templates that capture P and S waves.\n",
    "6. Find new events by running the templates over continuous waveforms.\n"

    "From here, I think you could take a few detections and try to plot up data from the nodal arrays that were out and make record sections or something. I tried to only search in dates that were around the time of the nodal deployment so you have a good chance of getting a few detections/events at those times. Actually looking at the data is important, and is not something I've done much recently in the scope of this package.\n",
