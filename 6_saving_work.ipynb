    "## Saving to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save a project to GitHub if you have an account. There are two ways to save a project to GitHub or a git provider, forking or cloning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **cloning** when you have write access to a repository or are working on your own projects, it creates a local copy that you can directly push changes. This is the standard workflow for team members collaborating on shared repositories or working on personal projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use **forking** when you want to contribute to someone else's repository and don't have write permissions. In open source projects, forking creates an independent copy on GitHub that you control, allowing you to make changes freely and propose those changes to the original repository through pull requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you'll fork repositories to contribute to projects you don't own, then clone your fork to your local machine to actually work on it—so forking and cloning often work together rather than being alternatives to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forking\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking creates a complete copy of a repository on GitHub/GitLab under your account. It creates a new repository on GitHub. The fork is indepent but linked to the original. This means you have full control over your fork and can push changes to your fork. If you want to submit changes to the orginal repository, you can submit a pull request. The key advantage to forking is that the repository is created for you and can be cloned to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# 1. Fork on GitHub (click \"Fork\" button)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Clone YOUR fork to your computer\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project.git\n",
    "cd project\n",

    "# 3. Add the original repo as \"upstream\"\n",

    ">**Explainer:**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In the first step, use the Fork button to create a copy if the repository to your GitHub account.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The following step is to `clone` the forked repository to your computer where you can make changes.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Adding the original repo as `upstream` (the source) will allow you to receive updates via a `pull` request\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Updating your repository follows the standard commads of `git add .` which puts all the updated files into the git staging area, and `git commit` saves a snapshot of the repository at that time.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">`git push` updates your repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloning creates a local copy of a repository on your computer, but it does not create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab. Cloning copies all the code, history, and branches of the original repository which becomes your \"remote\" (called origin) repository. You can update your local repository by pulling changes from orignal repository, but you can't push changes unless you have write access.\n",

    "3. Enter repository name: my-project\n",
    "4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license\n",
    "5. Click \"Create repository\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**\n",
    "Connect your local repository to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Add the remote repository\n",
    "git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-project.git\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify remote was added\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "# Output:\n",

    "git branch -M main\n",
    "\n",
    "# Push your code to GitHub\n",
    "git push -u origin main\n",
    "The -u flag sets upstream tracking, so future pushes only need git push.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "Make changes and save them to the remote repository.\n",
