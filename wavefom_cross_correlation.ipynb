    "We processed all day-long waveforms by applying a linear detrending, removing the mean of the data, applying a Hanning taper of 5% in each end of the waveform and applying a bandpass Butterworth filter between 5 and 12 Hz. To make the templates, we selected windows of 3 s around the P wave (0.2 s before P-arrival to 2.8 s after P-arrival) and whenever S-phase information was available, 2 s around the S wave (0.2 s before S-arrival to 1.8 s after S-arrival). We used 0.6 as the absolute cross-correlation value threshold for all detections and scanned individual channels in parallel using EQcorrscan. This procedure yielded 1,229,681 individual detections."

    "For the polarization analysis, we selected a 0.9 s-long time window starting from the P wave onset and filtered the waveforms using a bandpass acausal Butterworth filter in the 2.5–4.5 Hz frequency band. The polarization parameters were estimated using a sliding time window with length equal to the maximum investigated period and overlap of 50 %. Finally, results associated with highly linearly polarized body waves were extracted by taking those values of azimuth and incidence angle corresponding to RL higher than 0.7."

    "Three data streams are generated by bandpass filtering to three frequency ranges, which captures different parts of the volcano-seismic signal. Filtering between 2 to 5 Hz focuses on a tremor signal of frequent volcanic origin while excluding ocean noise at lower frequencies (mainly <1 Hz). This filtered time series was incremented into 10-min, non-overlapping windows with the average absolute velocity computed for the window. We refer to this as Real-time Seismic Amplitude Measurement (RSAM) although we acknowledge that RSAM is sometimes computed on the unfiltered or very loosely filtered trace, e.g., 0.5–20 Hz to exclude microseism/anthropogenic contributions. We compute Median Frequency (MF) and High Frequency (HF) data streams in the same way as RSAM but instead filtering in the range of 4.5 to 8 Hz and 8 to 16 Hz, respectively. These two data streams focus on signal attenuation effects above the frequency range from which tremor energy is commonly radiated16. Finally, Displacement Seismic Amplitude Ratio (DSAR) is calculated as the ratio of the integrals of the MF and HF signals22. High values of DSAR have been inferred to correlate with high gas levels in the edifice, suggesting either reduced fluid motion and/or trapping that has led to a gas-accumulation38,51. Time series gaps were imputed by linear interpolation and because these gaps occur in noneruptive periods, a later step of downsampling reduces their impact on the models50."

Then, we slice the data into one‐hour‐long windows, detrend, and taper the windows’ ends by 3%. The data are then filtered in three one‐octave‐wide frequency bands: 0.25–0.5, 0.5–1, and 1–2 Hz, resulting in three different datasets. Subsequently, we apply one‐bit normalization in the time domain. We obtain three groups of correlation functions (CFs): autocorrelations (single channel pairs), self‐correlations (single station, multichannel pairs), and cross‐correlations (multistation, multichannel pairs). For self‐ and cross‐correlations, we whiten the amplitude spectrum of the data (Bensen et al., 2007) in the Fourier domain. Finally, we average the resulting CFs over five days to reduce the amount of data and smooth the stacked CFs with a 60‐day‐wide moving Hanning taper, thereby weighing the contributions of particular five‐day stacks."
